# Discord Py Bot Template

This repo is a template for building a Discord bot using the [**discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) package.

This template is structured in preparation for using and testing cogs built with discord.py's [**Bot Commands Framework**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html)
